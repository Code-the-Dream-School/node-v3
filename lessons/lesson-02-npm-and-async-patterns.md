# Lesson Overview

This lesson covers:

Before starting lesson take a few minutes to watch these two final project examples. One uses EJS for front end and the other is a fullstack React app. These students incorporated something they were passionate about in their projects. Keep in mind the React apps UI can be acheived without React. *insert*

## Important Notes

- **Do not follow the git commands** shown around **2:03** in the main video.
- **Create the `.gitignore` file** as instructed.
- **Do not run `git init`** inside the `answers` directory. This will create a nested git repository, which can cause problems.
- **Ignore all git operations** shown in this and future videos. You already have the git repository you need.
