## Mindset

Your mindset is light this week just a reminder to breathe and **acknowledge your growth**

When presenting your project talk about your growth and setbacks in presentation. Questions to answer in your presentation:
 Did you encounter any problems? How did you resolve them? What resources did you use? What did you have the most fun building? Did you reach your end goal? How would you want to continue your project and grow it further?
