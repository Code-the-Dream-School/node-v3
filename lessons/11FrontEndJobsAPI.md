In this lesson, you create a front end for the Jobs API you created in the previous lesson. Front ends may be created in various ways, for example using React, and they may run in various environments, such as an app for a smart phone. The front end for this lesson is created using just HTML and JavaScript. It runs in a browser, and is loaded from the same Express instance as the API it calls. That is, you will be creating “server-rendered” pages.

**There is no video for this lesson. Instead, there are detailed instructions in the Assignment section.**

**Note:** This lesson appears to be mostly copy/paste — but it may not be depending on what you did the last few weeks! You create forms and tables, but if you used a data model different from Job, as was recommended in lessons 9 and 10, you must modify the HTML and JavaScript so that the forms, tables, and JavaScript variables match your data model. This may seem like a lot of work, and perhaps it is, but once you have completed it, if you used a data model different from the Job model used by the instructor (or you at least substantially extended that model) then you are well on your way to completing your class final project.


### Problem Solving

Though, at times, a solution may come together quickly first try, it more often than not takes some determination and thoughtful problem solving to see a new challenge over the finish line. (Pro tip: Those also end up being the truly satisfying wins!) But have you ever looked at a new problem and thought “I have no idea how to even get started!” …

Fear not! Problem solving is a learned skill too, and if you develop a solid process—ex. understanding the problem, planning, dividing the problem into subproblems—even the trickiest of challenges can be chipped away at.

This [FreeCodeCamp article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/) does a nice job of defining a problem solving process. Your preferred process may not end up mirroring this one exactly, but use this as inspiration to develop your own approach.

Take a little time during your lesson this week and consider the following:

Do you already have a problem solving process in place that you’ve found effective? If so, write it as a note to yourself to refer to if needed!
How does problem solving show up through other hobbies or activities in your life?
Have you observed others in the class solving problems differently than you do? What have you learned from their problem solving techniques?
