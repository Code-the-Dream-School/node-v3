Rmor reviews previous weeks materials. 
Don't worry it's not a proper test/quiz.
You can submit more than once.
Here are the questions to expect ahead of time: 

1. Given the URL http://example.com/api/tasks/123, which Express.js route pattern would match this URL to handle a task with ID 123?

2. In an Express.js app, which middleware is commonly used for validating and sanitizing user input?

a) body-parser
b) express-validator
c) cors
d) helmet

3. What is the purpose of a wrapper function in Express.js for error handling?

a) To validate request parameters

4. Which of the following practices are recommended for handling errors and validating input in a Node.js Express API? (Select all that apply)

a) Use try/catch blocks within asynchronous route handlers to catch errors.
b) Implement custom error classes to represent specific types of errors.
c) Rely solely on client-side validation and avoid server-side validation.
d) Use express-validator middleware to sanitize and validate incoming request data.
e) Define global error-handling middleware to catch and handle errors from routes and other middleware.


5. Did the past two weeks building out an API give you an idea or change your idea for your project?
