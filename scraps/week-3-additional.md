In the `node-express-course/week_3_alt_assignment` directory, a sample express application is provided. This is to give you a chance to do something creative with Express! Completion of the assignment is optional.The goals of the lesson are in the `README.md` in that folder, and the instructions are in `index.js`. You should first run the sample. You can then follow the instructions to create your own simple game. You’d give your file a name like `app.js` (also within the same directory, and you’d change the `package.json` so that the start command runs `app.js` instead of `index.js`. The example shows how HTML returned by the application can be made dynamic, through string interpolation. We’ll learn another way to return dynamic HTML later in the course. You should certainly run the sample application, as it explains important concepts. Creation of your own game is optional, but recommended.
