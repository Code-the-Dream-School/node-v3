Problem Solving

Though, at times, a solution may come together quickly first try, it more often than not takes some determination and thoughtful problem solving to see a new challenge over the finish line. (Pro tip: Those also end up being the truly satisfying wins!) But have you ever looked at a new problem and thought “I have no idea how to even get started!” …

Fear not! Problem solving is a learned skill too, and if you develop a solid process—ex. understanding the problem, planning, dividing the problem into subproblems—even the trickiest of challenges can be chipped away at.

This FreeCodeCamp article does a nice job of defining a problem solving process. Your preferred process may not end up mirroring this one exactly, but use this as inspiration to develop your own approach.

Please answer the below prompts in your assignment submission:

Do you already have a problem solving process in place that you’ve found effective? If so, tell us about it!
How does problem solving show up through other hobbies or activities in your life?
Have you observed others in the class solving problems differently than you do? What have you learned from their problem solving techniques?
