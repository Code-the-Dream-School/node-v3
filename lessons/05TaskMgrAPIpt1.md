Watch the “CodingAddict – Build 4 Node/Express Projects” video here:
**[CodingAddict - Build 4 Node/Express Projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rltfdjcXjmk)**

Watch from 0:00:00 to 1:28:45 of the video; stop at the section on validation (next session’s lesson will start with validation)

In this lesson and in several that follow, **you duplicate the work of the instructor**, testing as you go with Postman. Since you will be building and testing as you watch, read through the Coding Assignment section below _**before**_ starting the video.
