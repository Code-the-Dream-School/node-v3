## Refresh
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a simple format for storing and exchanging data, which is consistent and easy to read and write for both humans and machines.

## Watch the Video

- Finish watching **[this video](https://youtu.be/Oe421EPjeBE?t=13246)**.
- Focus on the part from **6:10:46** to the end of the video.
- The video explains how to handle form data and JSON data in requests and responses.

## What You Will Learn

1. **Middleware**
   - Learn about middleware, which is code that runs before your main request handlers.

2. **HTTP Methods**
   - How you will use different HTTP methods in your API development:
     - **`GET`**: Retrieve data.
     - **`POST`**: Send new data.
     - **`PUT`**: Update existing data.
     - **`PATCH`**: Partially update data.
     - **`DELETE`**: Remove data.

3. **Testing with Postman**
   - Test these HTTP methods using Postman to make sure requests and responses are working as expected.

4. **Refactoring Code**
   - Improve your code by separating the router and controller functions.

## Front End Interaction

- **Two Ways to Call APIs:**
  1. **Using HTML**
     - Send `GET` and `POST` requests from a standard HTML page.
     - `POST` requests send form data.

  2. **Using JavaScript**
     - JavaScript can send `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests.
     - Use JSON to send and receive data.

- **Find the Front End**
  - Check the `methods-public` directory.
  - Review the two HTML files to see how to call the backend using HTML and JavaScript.
