## Mindset

Your mindset is light this week just a reminder to breathe and **acknowledge your growth**

When presenting your project talk about your growth and setbacks in presentation. Questions to answer in your presentation:
 Did you encounter any problems? How did you resolve them? What resources did you use? What did you have the most fun building? Did you reach your end goal? How would you want to continue your project and grow it further?

### Mindset 

No coding assignment this week

Self-Motivation
 
 We hope throughout this course these Mindset Curriculum prompts and materials have helped you strengthen some evergreen skills that will serve you well - no matter what tech stack, language, library, or any other tech tool you’re working with now or in the future!
Our last assignment will help you spread your wings and fly. As we’ve said multiple times throughout this coursework, the tech field is ever-changing. This article <https://www.bomberbot.com/self-improvement/how-to-design-your-own-learning-plan-to-master-any-tech-stack/> is a great resource to help you create your own path of continued learning in the event there aren’t affordable structured learning opportunities on a topic you want to learn.
Now that you’re at the end of your advanced class, we hope and expect that you will be ready to start looking for entry level jobs or internships following your Practicum. Read through the transcript of this podcast from CodeNewbie to get some insights on the next chapter of your coding journey!
From the day you applied to Code the Dream, you became a part of our family. We hope you all stay connected with us through Slack or email. We want to be here for you if you’re facing challenges and we want to be here to cheer when you share your successes.
