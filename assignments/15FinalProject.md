You're at the end!  Remember to breathe and **acknowledge your growth!**

Complete your final project and make your 3-5 minute recording demonstrating your work.  When presenting your project talk about your growth and setbacks in presentation. Questions to answer in your presentation:
 - Did you encounter any problems? How did you resolve them? What resources did you use?
 - What did you have the most fun building?
 - Did you reach your end goal?
 - How would you want to continue your project and grow it further?

Both of these videos will set you up for success and may help you feel more comfortable with your presentation.  Reach out to mentor and classmates if you need moral support or a practice audience!
